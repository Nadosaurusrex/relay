    "## Key Lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. LLMs Are Not Security Boundaries\n",
    "- Can be manipulated through prompting\n",
    "- Cannot be trusted for access control\n",
    "- Need external enforcement (the air gap)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Prevention > Detection\n",
    "- Blocking attacks is cheaper than cleanup\n",
    "- Real-time enforcement prevents damage\n",
    "- Audit trails help but don't undo breaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Policies Must Be External\n",
    "- Not in agent code (can be buggy)\n",
    "- Not in LLM context (can be injected)\n",
    "- Separate enforcement layer (Relay)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Compliance Is Non-Negotiable\n",
    "- GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA, PCI requirements\n",
    "- Fines can destroy companies\n",
    "- Audit trails are mandatory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Defense in Depth\n",
    "- Relay is one layer\n",
    "- Combine with: network isolation, secrets management, monitoring\n",
    "- But Relay is the critical \"last line of defense\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Production Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deploying agents to production:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Identify critical actions (payments, data access, infrastructure)\n",
    "- [ ] Map business rules to policies\n",
    "- [ ] Test policies with realistic scenarios\n",
    "- [ ] Deploy Relay in staging first\n",
    "- [ ] Monitor audit logs for unexpected patterns\n",
    "- [ ] Set up alerts for policy violations\n",
    "- [ ] Train team on reviewing audit trails\n",
    "- [ ] Document escalation procedures\n",
    "- [ ] Schedule regular policy reviews\n",
    "- [ ] Integrate with incident response plan\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Review these scenarios with your security team\n",
    "2. Identify your top 5 risks\n",
    "3. Write policies to address them\n",
    "4. Deploy to staging and run tests\n",
    "5. Monitor and iterate\n",
