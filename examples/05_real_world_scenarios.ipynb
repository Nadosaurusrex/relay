    "| Scenario | Domain | Risk | Prevented Loss |\n",
    "|----------|--------|------|----------------|\n",
    "| [06. Vendor Negotiation](06_vendor_negotiation.ipynb) | Sales & Finance | High | $1,440/year |\n",

    "\n",
    "Each scenario shows:\n",
    "- ❌ **Without Relay**: What goes wrong\n",
    "- ✅ **With Relay**: How it's prevented\n",
    "- 📊 **Audit Trail**: Forensics and compliance\n",
    "- 🔧 **Policy YAML**: Implementation guide"

    "\n",
    "**Conservative scenario** (prevents 1 incident/year):\n",

    "Single prevented incident:  $50,000\n",
    "Relay annual cost:          $1,200\n",
    "ROI:                        4,067%\n",
    "Payback period:             < 1 week\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insurance Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Many cyber insurance policies:\n",
    "- **Require** agent governance systems\n",
    "- Offer **premium discounts** (10-30%)\n",
    "- Demand **audit trails** for claims\n",
    "- May **refuse coverage** without controls\n",
    "\n",
    "Relay provides all requirements and often pays for itself through insurance savings alone."

    "## Key Lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. LLMs Are Not Security Boundaries\n",
    "- Can be manipulated through prompting\n",
    "- Cannot be trusted for access control\n",
    "- Need external enforcement (the \"air gap\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Prevention > Detection\n",
    "- Blocking attacks is cheaper than cleanup\n",
    "- Real-time enforcement prevents damage\n",
    "- Audit trails help but don't undo breaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Policies Must Be External\n",
    "- Not in agent code (can be buggy)\n",
    "- Not in LLM context (can be injected)\n",
    "- Separate enforcement layer (Relay)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Compliance Is Non-Negotiable\n",
    "- GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA, PCI requirements\n",
    "- Fines can destroy companies\n",
    "- Audit trails are mandatory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Defense in Depth\n",
    "- Relay is one critical layer\n",
    "- Combine with: network isolation, secrets management, monitoring\n",
    "- But Relay is the \"last line of defense\" for agent actions"
