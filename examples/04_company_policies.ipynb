    "## Mapping Process: Business Rule → Technical Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Identify the Rule Type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Financial Rules:**\n",
    "- \"No payments over $X\" → `amount.max` constraint\n",
    "- \"Spending limit per Y\" → rate limiting policy\n",
    "- \"Require approval for $Z+\" → workflow policy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access Control:**\n",
    "- \"Only engineers can deploy\" → `agent_id` whitelist\n",
    "- \"Prod access restricted\" → `environment` constraint\n",
    "- \"Manager approval required\" → approval workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety Rules:**\n",
    "- \"Never delete production\" → environment deny rule\n",
    "- \"Read-only access\" → method allowlist\n",
    "- \"No destructive operations\" → provider/method deny\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compliance:**\n",
    "- \"Log all data access\" → audit enforcement\n",
    "- \"PII handling restrictions\" → parameter constraints\n",
    "- \"Retention policy limits\" → time-based rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Map to YAML Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Rule:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Agents cannot delete production databases\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**YAML Mapping:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "policies:\n",
    "  - name: \"production_protection\"\n",
    "    rules:\n",
    "      - id: \"block_prod_deletion\"\n",
    "        condition:\n",

    "        action: \"deny\"                  # Allow or deny\n",
    "        reason: \"Cannot delete production databases\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Add Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numeric Constraints:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "amount.max: 5000        # Maximum value\n",
    "amount.min: 100         # Minimum value\n",
    "count.max: 100          # Maximum count\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**String Constraints:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "environment.equals: \"production\"\n",
    "region.in: [\"us-east-1\", \"us-west-2\"]\n",
    "user_id.matches: \"^admin-.*$\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boolean Constraints:**\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "require_mfa: true\n",
    "allow_external: false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Test & Validate\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write policy in YAML\n",
    "2. Compile to Rego\n",
    "3. Test with sample manifests\n",
    "4. Verify both allow and deny cases\n",
    "5. Deploy to staging first\n",
    "6. Monitor audit logs\n",
    "7. Promote to production\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "**Git Workflow:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create branch\n",
    "git checkout -b policy/spending-limits\n",
