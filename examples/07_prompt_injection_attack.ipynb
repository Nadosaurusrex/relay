    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Domain**: Security & Customer Support\n",
    "- **Risk Level**: Critical\n",
    "- **Time**: 10-15 minutes\n",
    "- **Prevents**: Fraud, unauthorized refunds, prompt injection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt injection is one of the most serious threats to LLM agents. Attackers craft inputs designed to override the agent's instructions and execute unauthorized actions. This scenario shows how Relay's air gap makes prompt injection attacks ineffective, even when the LLM is completely compromised.\n",

    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How prompt injection attacks work\n",
    "- Why LLM-based security controls fail\n",
    "- How external policy enforcement provides the \"air gap\"\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLMs are NOT security boundaries** - they can be manipulated through prompting\n",
    "- **The air gap is critical** - policy enforcement must be external to agent context\n",
    "- **Even a compromised LLM is harmless** if actions are gated by external policies\n",
    "- **Audit trails enable detection** of attack attempts for security analysis\n",
    "- **Defense in depth** - Combine Relay with input validation and monitoring\n",
