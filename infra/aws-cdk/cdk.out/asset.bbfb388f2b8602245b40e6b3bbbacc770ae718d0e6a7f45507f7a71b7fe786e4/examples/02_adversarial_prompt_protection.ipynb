    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LLMs are persuadable** - They can be convinced to do things through clever prompting\n",
    "2. **Policies are not** - Mathematical logic cannot be socially engineered\n",
    "3. **The air gap protects** - Even compromised agents cannot violate policies\n",
    "4. **Audit trail provides** - Complete record of all attempts (successful and failed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Financial agents**: Cannot be tricked into unauthorized payments\n",
    "- **Infrastructure agents**: Cannot be manipulated into dangerous operations\n",
    "- **Data agents**: Cannot be convinced to leak sensitive information\n",
    "- **Purchasing agents**: Cannot be socially engineered by vendors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ See `03_langchain_integration.ipynb` for real framework integration\n",
    "- ✅ Check `04_company_policies.ipynb` for mapping business rules to policies\n",
